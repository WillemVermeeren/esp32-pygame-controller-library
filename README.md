# esp32-pygame-controller-library
A quick library I made so you can use your esp32 as a controller in a pygame game.

You are not allowed to change/remove/disable the loading screen til 2023, apart for that you are allowed to do anything you want.

Also this library and it's instructions are in Dutch.


there is an error that may occure somthing with use_2to3, if you have this then run this command "pip install setuptools==58"
