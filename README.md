# esp32-pygame-controller-library
A quick library I made so you can use your esp32 as a controller in a pygame game.

You are not allowed to change/remove/disable the loading screen til 2023, apart for that you are allowed to do anything you want.

Also this library and it's instructions are in Dutch.
